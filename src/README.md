# BlackJack

### Description

This object-oriented programs simulates a very basic game of BlackJack in which the user plays as many hands as they would like against a dealer. The user is displayed a simple menu from which they can start up a game. From there, the user is dealt a hand, and has the option to either hit or stand as long as they do not bust or hit BlackJack. The dealer follows basic BlackJack logic and will draw cards until their hand is either equal to or above 17, from there a winner is determined by comparing hand values.

### Techs used

This program utilizes multiple classes designed to mimic an actual real life game of BlackJack. It includes instances of abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance. It relies on interaction between the different classes using things such as instantiation and getters and setters as well as toStrings. It uses enums for the rank and suits of these cards as these are hard-set values that do not need to change. The logic of this program uses things like a lot of if and else if statements, as well as a couple of switches and foreach loops.   

### Takeaways
I found the most challenging part of building this program was just trying to get started. It took a good amount of planning and thinking through exactly how I wanted all of the classes to interact with each other before I could even begin to lay down code. A big piece of the puzzle came together when I figured out how to get cards from the deck and deal them into the player and dealer's hands. For me, it was a really good practice in using UML's and notes to come up with a strong game plan. I had to convert everything that I wanted to do into clear English before I was able to start coding.
